#### A delay model for satellite constellation networks with inter-satellite links

- Non-geostationary, Galileo-like constellation at MEO w/ permanent topology
- Applications: Air Traffic Control and Air Passenger Communications
- 2 inter-orbit 2 intra-orbit with 3 orbital inclinations with 10 sat per orbit
- Many assumptions made reducing the problem space considerably
- Optical is apparently the way forward
- Maj of the focus on impact of handover
- Fig 6 shows a nice worst case traffic scenario
- Modeling delay characteristics with Markov Chain (autocorrelation behavior)
- Several interesting statistics applications
- Lacks details on policies mostly presents a model for representing delay
