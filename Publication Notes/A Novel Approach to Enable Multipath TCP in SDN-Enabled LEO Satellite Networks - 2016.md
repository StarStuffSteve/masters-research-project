### A Novel Approach to Enable Multipath TCP in SDN-enabled LEO Satellite Networks

- MPTCP to better handle handover
- MPTCP augmented with SDN controller with view over entire sat network
- SDN controller has a management plane which can signal specific failures to controllers
- See within for LEO orbital information
- Replace fiber with this new wonder arrangement
- Sats considered equivlent to SDN switches
- SDN controller is on ground
- Core idea centers around a backup path
- More dynamic more power
- SDN approach centralizes control and reduces control overhead vs. say distributed algorithm approach
- Almost seems too obvious
- Basic simulations using Mininet
