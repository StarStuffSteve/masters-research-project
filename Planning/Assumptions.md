#### Orbital Configuration
- 25 CubeSats (C/Ss)
- Orbital altitude at approx. 600km (_~150 km higher than TW_) 
- Initial pass straight line inter-orbit distance approx. 50km
- 5 Orbits serparted by approx. 5 degrees 
- _Sun synchronized_ 
- Polar orbits
- No orbital control capabilities
- Minimal attitude control (_no enough for directional comms_)
- No meaningful inter-sat ranging capabilities

#### Node Capabilities
- Crosslink radios are omni-directional 1.2kbps (Nodes _cannot get Gamalink rates_)
- 1W crosslink receieve and transmit power consumption (COPINS)
- Node can get accurate time and location from GPS network
- Node is preloaded with UTC windows for every ground station fly-over
- Downlink 9.6 kbps (TW) at 3W power consumption (COPINS)

#### Ground
- Knows positions of Satellites accurately
- _can wake up a sleep C/S overhead_
- Can send either basic commands for a certain Sat or an update of satellite positions
