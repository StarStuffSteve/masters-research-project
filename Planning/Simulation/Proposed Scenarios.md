# Proposed Simulations Scenarios

### Formations

#### 1
- Single orbit 
- Leader-follower formations
- Orbit is fixed
- Spacings are fixed & equal
- Constant ground access
- All sats assumed deployed at the same time

##### 1.2
- Intermittent ground access

##### 1.3
- Intermittent ground access
- Spacings are initially all equal
- Spacings change over time (TW based)

##### 1.4
- Intermittent ground access
- Spacing reflect numerous small clusters
- Inter-cluster spacing changes over time

##### 1.3/4.2
- ...
- Satellites added/'removed' over time

#### 2
- Multi orbits
- Orbits are 'parallel'
- Individual orbits are fixed
- In-orbit spacings are fixed & equal
- Constant ground access
- All sats assumed deployed at the same time

##### 2.2
- ...
