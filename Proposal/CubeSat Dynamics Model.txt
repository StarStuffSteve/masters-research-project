Basics Objectives

	- Use existing TW and Nodes data to create probability distribution for distance change between CubeSats for some time step -> sample distribution to simulate movement of CubeSats

	- Calculate minimum distance between sats in a single Sun-Sync Polar Oribtal (SSPO) (600-800km LEO)

	- Calculate max oribtal inclination offsets for SSPOs (Assuming 75km max comms effective distance)

	- Investigate affects of orbital velocity difference on inter-orbit communication windows
