### Communication problem statements
- No best practice exists for inter-orbit communication within a constellation of CubeSats (C/Ss)
    + Small swarms of C/Ss in one orbit have been shown capable of effectively scheduling communications
    + In-orbit communication scheduling may need to be adjusted as each swarm is tasked with communication with swarms in adjacent orbits

- Election of the optimal C/S master to transmit/recieve data to/from a ground station
    + _The previous problem must first be addressed_
    + Could multiple C/Ss recieve from ground without unncessarily compromising mission longevity due to battery consumption?

- Propagation of command and control (C&C) instructions across the swarm
    + _The previous problem must first be addressed_

### Key metrics
1. Individual C/S battery consumption
2. Utilization of ground station communication windows
2. Utilization of inter-oribt communication windows
3. Percentage of constellation science data transmitted to ground
4. Percentage distribution of C&C data accross swarm
