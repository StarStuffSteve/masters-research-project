# TCD MAI Computer Engineering: Research Project

Project being completed as part of a taught masters in computer engineering at the [Trinity College Dublin](tcd.ie)

__Supervisor__: [Dr. Johnathan Dukes](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Jonathan.Dukes/)

### Overview:
The project seeks to create an emulation of a low earth orbit (LEO) CubeSat network and assess the potential efficacy of a number of distributed applications thereon.

The proposal and planning directories contain a number of potentially helpful overview documents. The current reading list file will also give a good indication of the state of the art being considered.
