# TCD MAI Computer Engineering: Research Project

Project being completed as part of a taught masters in computer engineering at the [Trinity College Dublin](tcd.ie)

__Supervisor__: [Dr. Johnathan Dukes](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Jonathan.Dukes/)

### Overview:
The project seeks investigate potential approaches to balancing power consumption with data throughput within CubeSat networks. The end goal of the world is shed light on methods which may be employed in future missions to maximize science data collection and mission duration. To this end a number of simulations of customized protocols are carried out with OMNeT++.
