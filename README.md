# TCD MAI Computer Engineering: Research Project

Project being completed as part of a taught masters in computer engineering at the [Trinity College Dublin](tcd.ie)

__Supervisor__: [Dr. Stephen Farrell](https://www.cs.tcd.ie/Stephen.Farrell/)

### Overview:
The project seeks to create an emulation of a low earth orbit (LEO) CubeSat network and assess the potential efficacy of a number of distributed applications thereon.
