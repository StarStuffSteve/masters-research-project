Tianwang-1
==========

#### Overview

- 3 CubeSats (3U, 2U, 2U)
- Launched 25/9/16 - [Link](http://www.n2yo.com/database/?q=%09+TIANWANG#results)
- Missions is __test SDRs__ in space

“Using MEMS based cold-gas micropropulsion, it is planned to demonstrate formation flying by two of the CubeSats along with inter-satellite communication using GAMALINK 2.4 GHz spread spectrum technology from Portugal”

“The satellites will make inter satellite communication sessions using the __GAMALINK__ Portuguese technology developed by the Portuguese company Tekever”  - Same tech will be on Proba-3!

1B and 1C will formation fly using an ISL

GAMANET protocol for downlink
