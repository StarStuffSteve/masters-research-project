Edison Demonstration of Smallsat Networks (EDSN)

Overview

	Eight satellites carrying a science experiment and capable of inter-communication. 
	Lost on the ORS-4 mission. 
	1.5U and 2kg w/ no propulsion and would have drifted apart in orbit naturally
	Take turns in downlink
	Data is replicated across the swarm
	Based out of Ames
	Planned 60 day duration
	Will drift apart once deployed

Technology and Capabilities

	Android innards based off the earlier PhoneSat 2.0 bus
	Data exchanged using ‘hub and spoke’ topology
	The hub (captain) is switched every 25 hours
	Hub collects all data, aggregates and arranges for transmit
	“The satellites will continue recording science data and downlinking to the ground station even after they exceed inter-satellite communication range”
	Science payload measures energies of nearby charged particles (EPISEM)
	There is a degree of attitude and orbital control/determination
	Data bus between subsystems is simple ACK, ReTrans setup
	Hardware Watchdog w/ timer

	“Microhard Systems Inc MHX2420 transceiver” for S2G S-Band (Specced at 50km) FHSS 38.4kbps
	Crosslink performed with “AstroDev Lithium 1” 9.6kbps (Contradiction) using AX.25 at 1W <20km ISL range
	Captain pings each LT (Lieutenant) six times (common frequency so pings have IDs)
	Only one LT talks at any one time
	No ACK or NACK between CPT and LT, no guarantee of successful TX (Future Work)
	CPT puts LT packets onto FIFO queue which is pushed onto a LIFO stack for downlink (Priority is LT health data)
	There is downlink stack for each LT
	GPS data is used to sync clocks (UTC) and start CPT rotation
	UTC time used to coordinate wake ups of the LTs
	Only uplink is to disable all communications (FCC requirement)


Flight Software Release 6.5
	Mission Simulations were performed with the vehicles in a lab No sign of SW based simulation or planning
	Papers states that tests indicated expected performance
	Nothing about how captain handover happens


Could CDFS and CTP work well on top of EDSN?
