COPINS Notes

E-mail:
ISL is S-Band ("ESA furnished item currently under development.")
"such transceivers establish a distributed network (not centrally managed by the orbiter) as well as clock synchronisation and ranging capabilities"
Network is orbiter, CubeSats and lander
*Gamalink perhaps involved

Planning and support documentation:
	SysNova Doc (Last pages are most interesting):
		Assessment/Spec of potential solutions w/o much technical data or specifics

		ISL Comms for "telecommand, housekeeping, payload telemetry data relay"

		2x3U available
		3 month lifetime at asteroid
		<200g txcr + 2 antennae 60g providing omni-dir comms
		!!! 1W receieve and 3W transmit power consumption
		Full duplex
		Symmtrical data rate of 'up to' 1 Mbps
		Total mission data value of up to 1 Gbit

	AD2 Docs:
		Info on asteroids, mostly not directly relevant

	AD50:
		CDF - Concurrent Design Facility
		H/LFR - High/Low Frequency Radar

		To "release" CubeSats
		Not much else

	RD2:
		More on mascot and more scheduling but not a lot of COPINS

	AD1 Payload i/f:
		Optel-D optical downlink system of 2.5 Gbps downlink rate capability
		1550 nm C-band

		Peak COPINS ISL data rate - 1 kbit/s ...
		... Some COPINS specs but nothing that I can see on comm i/f

	RD1 230 pages - Really Interesting:
		-----
		Total Mass [kg] (including 10% margin)
		13.2
		Power required during cruise for battery charging [W]
		1
		Data volume over lifetime (to be relayed to GS through AIM s/c) [Gbit]
		2
		Required pointing accuracy [°]
		+- 0.25
		Required positioning knowledge of S/C [m]
		+- 50
		Max. / Min. operational temperature [C°]
		30 / - 30
		Max. / Min. non-operational temperature [C°]
		50 / - 35
		-----

		Deployed after one month

		Page 130 is interesting
		
		!!! ISL - Page 136 on

		'Alternatives' ... ?
		• Proba-3 (Gamalink):
			o Best estimation at present is 1.5kg (including 20% margin) redundant and 0,3kg non-redundant w/o casing (for lander)
			o Preliminary Link Budget can be closed for 1Mbps (4MHz BW), 100km range and 1W RF and hemispherical antennas on both side. TBC
			o No support of Lander localisation (radiotracking)
		• FLYCON:
			o Proof of concept for a dual Communication and Navigation system for formation flying based on commercial wireless standard (WiMax, WiFi…). TRL 4 by Semester 2 of 2015
		-----

		Gamalink:
		• Power: 1W RX (single receiver), 4W TX+RX(1W RF, single receiver). All TBC
		• Other features:
			o Networking capability (multiple nodes communications, based on CDMA)
			o Coarse range estimation (1-10 m TBC, based on RF base band processing/Kaman filtering TBC).

		... lots more in doc but likely little of it relevant
